# ============================================
# PYTHON COMPILED FILES
# ============================================
# Python automatically creates these when you run your code to speed things up.
# They're recreated every time, so no need to track them in Git.
# Think of these as "temporary helper files" Python makes for itself.
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python

# ============================================
# VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
# ============================================
# Your virtual environment folder contains all installed packages (PyTorch, ultralytics, etc).
# This can be 500MB+ with thousands of files.
# DON'T commit this - other developers will create their own venv using requirements.txt
# It's like not sharing your entire grocery bag, just sharing the shopping list.

# ============================================
# PYCHARM IDE SETTINGS
# ============================================
# Your personal PyCharm preferences (theme, window layout, code style, etc).
# Other developers might use VS Code or have different PyCharm settings.
# This is like your personal desk setup - not part of the actual project.

# ============================================
# YOLO TRAINING OUTPUTS
# ============================================
# YOLO generates these folders/files during training and inference

# Training results (logs, graphs, metrics, example predictions)
# Gets recreated every time you train, and can be several GB
runs/

# Model weights - these files can be 40MB-200MB each
# Too large for Git. Share via Google Drive or Git LFS instead.
# Ignores all .pt files in the models/ directory
models/*.pt

# Exception: If you want to keep a specific pretrained model, uncomment this:
# !models/yolo11s.pt

# Your training images and annotations - often gigabytes of data
# Store separately or use Git LFS for large datasets
datasets/

# Downloaded test images and data files
# These are auto-downloaded by scripts, no need to commit
data/*.jpg
data/*.jpeg
data/*.png
data/*.gif
data/*.mp4
data/*.avi

# YOLO creates these cache files to load data faster during training
# Auto-regenerated, no need to track them
*.cache

# ============================================
# MACOS SYSTEM FILES
# ============================================
# macOS creates these hidden files in every folder to remember Finder settings
# Completely useless to anyone not on Mac, just clutters your commits
.DS_Store

# ============================================
# WINDOWS SYSTEM FILES (if working cross-platform)
# ============================================
# Windows equivalents to .DS_Store - thumbnail cache and system files
